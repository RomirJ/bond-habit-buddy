    question: "How does the money-back system work?",
    answer: "You deposit $1-$20 per habit per day. If you complete your habit (verified automatically), you get your full deposit back. If you fail, the money becomes a service fee. You can never win more than you deposit."
  },
  {
    question: "How are habits verified automatically?",
    answer: "DailyDrop uses your iPhone's built-in sensors and apps: HealthKit for steps/sleep/exercise, Screen Time for app usage, and integrations with apps like Apple Books. No manual check-ins required."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this gambling?",
    answer: "No. You can only get back what you put inâ€”there's no upside or winnings. This is pure accountability. You're paying for a service that helps enforce your habits through financial commitment."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I travel or get sick?",
    answer: "Premium subscribers get 'insurance days' and other features to handle life's interruptions fairly. The goal is accountability, not punishment for things outside your control."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does DailyDrop cost?",
    answer: "The basic habit tracking and money bonds are free. Premium features like analytics, insurance days, and friend support cost $2.99/week, $9.99/month, or $79.99/year with a 3-day free trial."
  },
  {
    question: "When will DailyDrop be available?",
    answer: "We're in private beta now. Join the waitlist to be notified when we launch on the App Store. We'll also send early access invites to waitlist members."
